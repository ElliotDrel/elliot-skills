## Skill Authoring

### Skill Templates

Reusable scaffolds live in `templates/` at the repo root (outside `skills/`, so they're never published, installed, or version-checked). Use a template when its shape fits the skill; adapt it to the task instead of adding structure the user does not need.

- **`templates/coaching-skill/`** — for a skill that coaches the user through a decision using one or more named frameworks and ends with a concrete artifact. This is the shape `estack-leadership-coach` and `estack-productivity-prioritization-coach` share. It defines the standard component set (identity → primary outcome → voice → calibrate depth → framework → coaching protocol → acceptance bar → handling resources → sources → feedback) and ships both reference tiers: a lightweight `sources/` model and a heavier `references/` knowledge vault with an `adding-references.md` playbook. Keep the tier you use, delete the other.

To instantiate: `cp -r templates/coaching-skill skills/estack-<name>`, rename `SKILL.template.md` → `SKILL.md`, fill the `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`, resolve the tier files (rename `adding-references.template.md` or delete it; the sources template is a pattern to copy, then delete), then run `node scripts/update-skill-feedback.cjs`. No `.template.md` file may remain in the finished skill — it would ship to npm. Full instructions are in `templates/README.md`. The `manage-e-stack` add flow (`steps/add.md`) points here at step 1.

If a future skill is a different shape (a tool, converter, tracker), add a new template folder under `templates/` rather than forcing it into the coaching scaffold.

### Per-Skill Versioning

Every skill carries its own semver in SKILL.md frontmatter, independent of the package version in `package.json`:

```yaml
---
name: estack-example
version: 1.2.0
description: >-
  (example) Guide a concrete workflow when a user asks to set up, repair, or
  verify this specific capability.
---
```

- **New skills start at `1.0.0`.**
- **Bump on every content change** to the skill folder (SKILL.md, scripts, references, steps): patch for fixes/tweaks, minor for new capabilities, major for rewrites or breaking changes.
- **Use folded YAML for long descriptions** whenever the text contains `Use for:`, `Triggers:`, or any other colon followed by a space. Plain one-line YAML values cannot safely contain `: ` unless quoted.
- **Write the description as the moment the skill is needed.** Keep it concise, name the request or outcome it handles, and distinguish adjacent skills when that helps routing. Avoid broad topic lists, aggressive emphasis, and claims that it should run without a user-relevant reason.
- **Write the body for several models.** The pack is read by Claude Code, Codex, and other agents, and each release of those models needs less hand-holding than the last. Prefer intent plus boundaries over a step-by-step recipe, put workflow-specific material in `steps/` or `references/` files the root routes to, and reserve emphasis for real gates (destructive actions, credentials, never fabricating a citation).
- Hooks use a `// @version x.y.z` comment near the top of the file instead.
- **Enforcement:** `node scripts/check-versions.cjs` diffs every skill/hook against the last `v*` release tag and fails if content changed without a version bump. Run `--fix` to auto-patch-bump stale items. The publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) runs this check as a hard gate, so a release cannot ship a content change with a stale version.
- **Division of labor:** the installer detects updates via content hashes (deterministic, can't miss a change); versions are the trustworthy human-readable label — the installer shows `name (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)` transitions in its update messages, and the version travels with the installed copy so any machine can self-report what it has.

### Where a Skill Puts the Files It Creates

Every file a skill creates lands in one of four places. Decide which kind of file
it is first, then the location follows.

**1. Skill state → `~/.e-stack/<skill-folder>/`**

Anything the skill persists for its own use between runs: config, credentials,
caches, history, registries, cloned repos, internal artifacts. Use the skill's
full folder name — `estack-doc-review-viewer` owns
`~/.e-stack/estack-doc-review-viewer/`. The name is deliberately not shortened:
the installed skill, its frontmatter `name:`, and its state directory all answer
to one identity, which is also what keeps `check-skill-name.cjs` honest.

One folder holds everything every e-stack skill has ever written. The user has a
single directory to find, back up, inspect, or delete, instead of a dotfile per
skill scattered across the home directory.

**2. A deliverable the user asked for → wherever they said**

A document, export, or design the user requested is theirs, not skill state. It
goes where they asked, defaulting to the working directory. Never file a
deliverable into `~/.e-stack/` — they would never find it again.

**3. Ephemeral scratch → the system temp dir or the session scratchpad**

Intermediate output that does not outlive the run. `estack-flight-planner`'s
fetch scripts use `tempfile.gettempdir()` for raw API responses; that is correct
and should not move.

**4. A skill this skill generates → the skills directory**

`estack-book-extractor` installs what it produces into the user's skills folder,
unprefixed, because the result is their own reference library rather than part of
this pack.

Rules:

- **Never write beside the user's documents** unless the file *is* the
  deliverable. Their working directory holds their files and nothing a skill made
  for its own bookkeeping.
- **Never invent a new top-level dotfile** (`~/.my-skill/`), never use a bare home
  folder (`~/my-skill-storage/`), and never store state under `~/.claude/`, which
  belongs to Claude Code rather than to this pack.
- **Never store state inside the installed skill folder.** The installer
  overwrites it on every update.
- **Define the path once**, in a single exported constant, and derive every other
  path (including in tests) from it. A literal repeated in a test is how a moved
  root silently goes stale.
- **A skill that stores nothing needs none of this** — most skills are prose and
  should stay that way.
- **Enforcement:** `node scripts/check-paths.cjs` fails on a new home-directory
  dotfile, a bare home folder, and state under `~/.claude/`. A path a skill only
  *reads* (another tool's data) belongs in that script's `ALLOWED_PREFIXES`; a
  deliberate legacy-compatibility line gets an `estack-path-ok` comment on the
  line. The publish workflow runs it as a hard gate.
- **Create the directory before writing to it.** `~/.e-stack/<skill>/` does not
  exist on a fresh install. A skill that used to write into a folder the OS
  always provides (Documents, Desktop) has no `mkdir` anywhere in it and will
  throw `ENOENT` the first time it runs after moving.

---

### Credentials and Environment Variables

**Every API key, token, and secret in the pack lives in one file:
`~/.e-stack/.env`.** Not one per skill. A user who sets a key once has set it
for every skill that needs it, and a key two skills share is stored once.

Format is `KEY=value`, one per line. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are
ignored. Surrounding quotes are stripped.

```
# ~/.e-stack/.env
PULSE_API_KEY=abc123
SERPAPI_KEY=def456
```

**Resolution order, always:** the live process environment first, then
`~/.e-stack/.env`.

The installer follows the same rule for its own settings — `ESTACK_SKILLS_DIR`,
`ESTACK_HOOKS_DIR`, `ESTACK_BACKUP_DIR`, `ESTACK_NO_STATUSLINE`, and `ESTACK_HOME`
all live in this file too. It is the pack's single settings file, not just its
credential file, so a new persistent setting belongs here under an `ESTACK_*`
name rather than in a new JSON sidecar or marker file. A real environment variable wins so a one-off override works
without editing the file.

**An environment variable is an override, never a home.** Do not tell a user to
persist a key with `setx`, `SetEnvironmentVariable`, or a shell profile. A
process-local assignment such as `$env:KEY = ...` is appropriate for a deliberate
temporary override and should not be described as persistent configuration. A
persistent key outside `~/.e-stack/.env` can drift or shadow the shared value.
When a setup check finds an environment-only key, report it as an override; ask
whether it is intentional before suggesting a durable shared setting.

Rules:

- **Append, never overwrite.** The file is shared. A skill that writes a key by
  rewriting the whole file destroys every other skill's credentials. Read,
  replace-or-append the one line, write back — or tell the user to add the line
  themselves.
- **Store credentials only here.** Not in a per-skill `.env`, not in a skill's
  `config.json` next to preferences, and never inside the installed skill folder
  (the installer overwrites it on every sync). `estack-flight-planner` used to
  keep `serpapi_key` in its `config.json`; that field is gone, and preferences
  stay there without it.
- **Each skill reads the file itself.** Skills are installed independently, so a
  shared loader module would be a dependency a single-skill install cannot
  satisfy. Copy the ~15-line reader — `estack_env(name)` in
  `estack-pdf-to-md/scripts/pdf_to_md.py` and
  `estack-flight-planner/scripts/fetch_flights.py` are the reference
  implementations, and there is a bash equivalent in each skill's setup check.
- **Never print a key.** Report only whether it is set. This applies to setup
  checks, logs, and error messages.
- **Enforcement:** `node scripts/check-paths.cjs` fails on a per-skill `.env`, on
  a `.env` resolved relative to the script's own location, and on instructions to
  persist a credential-looking variable in OS configuration (`setx`, a shell
  profile, or `SetEnvironmentVariable`). Process-local temporary overrides are
  outside that rule. Assigning `$null` or an empty value clears a variable.
  Mark a deliberate legacy read with an `estack-path-ok` comment on the line.
- **Some env vars must stay unset.** `estack-drive-cli-agent` deliberately tells
  callers never to set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, or
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, because each one silently switches billing from the
  logged-in subscription to API-key mode. Those do not belong in this file.

Every skill that stores anything is on this convention. When you move an existing
skill's state, leave a legacy check behind: detect the old location, tell the user
where it moved and how to move their files, and let them decide. Never relocate a
user's file silently — `estack-flight-planner`'s `scripts/check_setup.sh` is the
worked example.

### Installer Maintenance

`node bin/install.cjs` previews changes by default. After the user has approved a
live install, agents and scripts should pass `--yes` with `--install` so a
non-interactive session can safely choose the documented backup-and-install path.
Use `--skip-modified` instead when the approved outcome is to retain local
modifications. Do not use either flag before showing the live-install preview and
getting approval.

The installer tracks installed package content in its checksum manifest. Removing
or renaming a shipped skill lets the manifest retire the installed copy and its
record; `DEPRECATED_SKILLS` is legacy compatibility for names that predate that
manifest, not a list for new removals.

Installer settings remain in `~/.e-stack/.env`. Update one setting with the
installer's `writeSetting()` helper so shared credentials and unrelated settings
survive. Treat the checksum manifest as installation state, not a second settings
file.

Test installer changes in an isolated home directory. On Windows, set
`USERPROFILE` to a temporary directory; on POSIX, set `HOME` to a temporary
directory. Run the installer with the intended flags there instead of experimenting
against a real user profile.

---

### Doc Listings (README.md + AGENTS.md)

Every skill and hook must be listed in two places:

- **README.md** — a row in the Skills table (`| **Title** | \`/estack-name\` | description |`) or the Hooks table
- **AGENTS.md** — the "Skills in the pack" / "Hooks in the pack" lines

**Enforcement:** `node scripts/check-docs.cjs` verifies both files against `skills/` and `hooks/`, failing on missing entries and stale names. Update these inventories when adding, removing, or renaming a skill or hook. Revise descriptions when the user-facing purpose materially changes; a narrow instruction edit does not require unrelated documentation churn.

---

### Skill Name Validation

`node scripts/check-skill-name.cjs <skill-name>` (or `--all` for every skill) verifies that a skill was migrated and self-references correctly. It checks:

1. Folder is named `skills/estack-<short>/`
2. Frontmatter `name:` matches the folder name exactly
3. Frontmatter `version:` exists and is semver (`x.y.z`)
4. Frontmatter `description:` starts with `(<short>)` — e.g. `(repo-search) Use when…`
5. No bare short-name self-references inside the skill's own files — every mention of `<short>` must be prefixed `estack-<short>` or wrapped as `(<short>)` (the description convention)

Allowed exceptions: mentions inside `references/` docs (prose about the skill's display name) and the `(<short>)` description prefix itself are not flagged as stale.

The publish workflow runs `--all` as a hard gate. Run it locally before tagging if you've renamed a skill or edited its frontmatter.

---

### Skill Feedback Section

Every skill should include a `## Skill Feedback` section at the bottom. This is managed via a shared template — do not edit it manually in individual skill files.

**To update the feedback text across all skills:**

1. Edit `scripts/skill-feedback-template.md` (use `{{SKILL_NAME}}` as the placeholder for the skill's name)
2. Run `node scripts/update-skill-feedback.cjs` — rewrites the section in every `skills/estack-*/SKILL.md`
3. Verify with `node scripts/update-skill-feedback.cjs --check` (exits 1 if any skill is out of sync)

The feedback section gathers enough context to draft a useful issue. It files through `gh issue create` only with explicit user authorization; otherwise it offers a reviewable draft or pre-filled issue URL.

---

### Prompting Guidance

Write instructions for the task at hand: state the outcome and relevant context,
preserve the user's instructions over template defaults, and use progressive
disclosure for supporting material. Complete authorized work, ask focused
questions only when an answer materially changes the result, and verify changes
in proportion to their risk. Keep factual claims tied to supplied or retrieved
sources rather than filling gaps from memory.

This guidance was reviewed on 2026-09-07 against [Prompting Claude Fable
5.1](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-fable-5-1)
and [OpenAI's GPT-6 Astra model guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model).
It applies their instruction and task-completion guidance; API and harness
configuration details belong in the integration that uses them.

### Auto-run commands

Use `` ```! `` (triple backtick + `!`) code blocks in SKILL.md to run shell commands automatically when the skill is loaded. The output is presented to the model before it processes the rest of the skill.

Use this for setup tasks, environment checks, or gathering context that the skill needs upfront.

**Example:**
- `skills/estack-repo-search/SKILL.md` — clones and indexes a repo on load

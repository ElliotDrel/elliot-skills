# Read Agent Session History

Search, read, recover, and analyze local AI coding-agent session history across **two agents** — **Claude Code** and **Codex** (OpenAI codex-cli): the current session, prior sessions, sibling subagents, all projects, and `.claude-backups` snapshots. One CLI reads both.

## The ladder — how to answer any session-history question

1. **A CLI mode fits** → use it. One deterministic command, done. Cross-agent modes read Claude **and** Codex by default (`--agent claude|codex|both`, default `both`).
2. **A mode almost fits** → run it with `--format json` and post-process the output (a python one-liner, jq, grep). Don't contort the question to fit the flags.
3. **No mode comes close** → write a one-off Python script in your scratchpad importing the primitives in `scripts/lib/` (`paths`, `parser`, `search`, `subagents`, `tools`, `codex` — the docstrings are the API reference). They encode the correctness traps below; never re-derive them.
4. **The same gap keeps recurring** → record the candidate improvement and use the supported one-off route for this task. Add a mode or flag only in an authorized skill-maintenance task (see "Record durable findings" below).

Never use the Read tool on a raw `.jsonl` (Claude **or** Codex), and never hand-roll parsing without `lib.parser` — both schemas have traps (noise entries, tool-result envelopes, UTC timestamps, and Codex's two-layer event/response streams). `lib.parser.parse_lines` auto-detects a Codex rollout and normalizes it into the same shape Claude emits, so every primitive works on both.

Writing your own script is a **normal, supported path**, not a defeat — it's the right move whenever the question is specific to the task at hand. Do it well by starting from the primitives instead of the raw file. Full guide with worked examples: `references/writing-your-own.md`.

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.home() / ".agents/skills/estack-read-agent-history/scripts"))
from lib import parser, paths, search, subagents, tools, codex

sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")   # required — see Pitfalls

lines = parser.parse_lines(Path(r"C:\Users\...\<uuid>.jsonl"))  # Path, not str, not a handle
msgs  = parser.get_messages(lines)          # [{role, texts, timestamp, is_compact, line_index}]
msgs  = parser.filter_by_time(msgs, since, until)   # datetimes, local, half-open [since, until)
msgs  = parser.filter_by_role(msgs, "user")         # "user" | "assistant" | "both"
```

**`parse_lines` takes a `pathlib.Path`.** Handing it a `str` or an open file object raises deep inside `codex.py`/`parser.py` and reads like a skill bug when it's a caller error. Everything else takes the list that `get_messages` returns.

## Where sessions live

**Claude Code:**
```
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl            # one file per session
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl  # subagent transcripts (+ .meta.json)
~/.claude-backups/{mirror,snapshot-24h,snapshot-1w,snapshot-1mo}/projects/…  # backups, same layout
```

`<encoded-cwd>` = the working directory with `:` `\` `/` and whitespace each replaced by `-`. The encoding is **lossy** — never reconstruct a real path from an encoded name; resolve by UUID or content.

**Codex:**
```
~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ISO-ts>-<uuid>.jsonl       # one "rollout" file per session, date-partitioned
```

Codex is date-partitioned (the folder IS the index — `ls ~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/15/`), and each rollout's real cwd/uuid live in its leading `session_meta` line. Both agents' entry schemas: `references/jsonl-schema.md`. The full Codex schema + traps: `references/codex-history.md`.

The current (Claude Code) session ID is: ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
(In a context where that substitution isn't visible — e.g. a subagent — read the real env var `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, or run `--mode whoami`.)

## Quick lookups (CLI)

```bash
PY="$HOME/.agents/skills/estack-read-agent-history/scripts/read_transcript.py"
```

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| THIS session's path | `python "$PY" --mode whoami --cwd "<cwd>"` |
| UUID prefix → path (either agent) | `python "$PY" --mode lookup --uuid abc123de` |
| **Are these UUIDs still resumable?** (batch, every root) | `python "$PY" --mode resumable --uuid-file ids.txt --deep` |
| List sessions (both agents) | `python "$PY" --mode list --all-projects --since 7d` |
| Keyword search everywhere | `python "$PY" --mode search --all-projects --query "supabase migration"` |
| 6-line session summary (either agent) | `python "$PY" --file <session-or-rollout.jsonl> --mode brief` |
| Last assistant / **user** message | `python "$PY" --file <s.jsonl> --mode last [--role user\|both]` |
| **Read a time window of one session** | `python "$PY" --file <s.jsonl> --mode dump --role user --since <T1> --until <T2>` |
| Pre-/compact recovery | `python "$PY" --file <session.jsonl> --mode pre-compact` |
| All subagent finals | `python "$PY" --file <parent.jsonl> --mode subagent-finals` |
| Day overview / "what did I do" | `python "$PY" --mode session-report --date yesterday` |
| Activity map with idle gaps | `python "$PY" --mode timeline --date yesterday` |
| My real attention time | `python "$PY" --mode engagement --date today` |
| Just one agent | add `--agent codex` (or `--agent claude`) to any cross-agent mode |
| `claude --resume` snippet | `python "$PY" --mode resume-cmd --uuid <prefix>` |

**`dump` is the workhorse for "what happened in this window."** `--role user` reads back the person's own prompts, which is what actually reconstructs a stretch of work — an assistant summary of the same window tells you what the model said, not what was asked for. `--role`, `--since`, and `--until` all apply; `-n` caps the count and defaults to the last 80 (use `-n 0` for everything in the window). Truncation prints a note to stderr, so if you don't see one, you got the whole window.

**Codex review gates are hidden by default** in `timeline` and `session-report`. Codex logs its internal review/approval step as a session of its own titled "The following is the Codex agent history…" — machine turns that can outnumber the real sessions. `--keep-review-gates` brings them back. In `session-report` the hidden gates leave the **list** but stay in the **total**, so the deduped attention number is still the real one. On a busy day, `timeline --max-per-block 4` also collapses each block's quiet tail in the text render.

**Both agents by default.** The cross-session modes merge Claude Code **and** Codex over one deduped prompt stream (parallel chats split the clock, never double-count); narrow with `--agent claude|codex`. Single-file modes (`--file`) auto-detect a Codex rollout — no flag needed.

Every mode takes `--format json` (a `source: "claude"|"codex"` field tags each session). Full reference (every mode, flags, exit codes, JSON shapes, the time-accounting semantics, `--agent`, and presentation defaults for day reviews): `references/modes.md`. Codex schema + gotchas: `references/codex-history.md`. Multi-step workflows: `references/recipes.md`.

## Pitfalls

- **Timestamps in both agents' .jsonl files are UTC.** CLI output and `lib.parser` conversions are already local — never mix raw with converted, never hand-add offsets. (Codex conveniently puts a top-level `timestamp` on every line; Claude on every entry.) Report times to the user in 12-hour format unless asked otherwise.
- **Raw entry counts lie — in both agents.** Claude `type:user` includes tool-result envelopes and hook/skill `isMeta` injections; `type:assistant` includes tool-only turns. Codex has TWO parallel layers (`event_msg` vs `response_item`) that mirror the same messages — count from one, not both, or you double. The CLI/`lib.parser` already handle this; never hand-tally.
- **Never hand-roll cross-agent time math.** The shared top-level `timestamp` tempts a `grep`+`awk` hack with a hardcoded UTC offset — `timeline`/`engagement` already merge both agents correctly.
- **A live transcript's last line may be truncated** — `lib.parser.iter_lines` handles it (Claude and Codex); bare `json.loads` per line crashes.
- **Bound your output.** Cross-project/cross-agent sweeps can emit tens of thousands of tokens; summarize per session, expand selectively.
- **Windows:** use `python` (not `python3`); pass Windows-style paths into Python (POSIX paths from Bash cause `FileNotFoundError`); run JSON pipe chains in Bash — PowerShell 5.1 pipes inject a BOM.
- **Never stage a file in `/tmp` on Windows.** Bash writes `/tmp/x.json` to `C:\Users\…\AppData\Local\Temp`, Python resolves `/tmp` to `C:\tmp` — and because `os.path.isdir('/tmp')` returns **True**, the directory check passes and only the read fails, so it looks like the CLI produced nothing. Write intermediates to the session scratchpad with a full Windows path. (This single trap accounted for five separate crashes in one day's work.)
- **Set your stdout encoding before printing transcript text.** Console stdout is cp1252 and dies on the first non-Latin-1 character: `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")` at the top of every script (or `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`).
- **`errors="replace"` is not optional.** Transcript text can carry unpaired surrogates (`'\udc8f'`) that survive JSON round-tripping and then kill even a UTF-8 `print` with `UnicodeEncodeError: surrogates not allowed`. Plain `encoding="utf-8"` does not save you.
- **Empty/weird results** → `--mode debug` prints the entry-type distribution and probes for schema drift. Codex reasoning is usually encrypted (`summary: []`), so `--in thinking` on a Codex session is often empty — that's expected, not drift.

## Backups

Four roots under `C:\Users\2supe\.claude-backups\` survive transcript-deletion incidents (like the March 2026 auto-update bug, GitHub #41591): `mirror`, `snapshot-24h`, `snapshot-1w`, `snapshot-1mo`. Every CLI mode accepts `--root <name>`; recovery playbook in `references/recipes.md`.

## Record durable findings

When evidence shows a durable schema change, incorrect instruction, or recurring gap, report it to the user. Update the source skill only in an authorized maintenance task, through its `manage-e-stack` flow: techniques go in `references/recipes.md`, Claude schema findings in `references/jsonl-schema.md`, Codex schema findings in `references/codex-history.md`, and new modes in the CLI plus `references/modes.md`. Do not edit an installed copy; the installer overwrites it. If the source repo is unavailable, offer a GitHub issue.

## Skill Feedback

If the user shares feedback about this skill — a bug, something confusing, a missing feature, or a suggestion — capture the useful details: what they expected, what happened, and relevant context. If they already provided enough detail, do not ask them to repeat it.

Draft a concise issue title prefixed with `estack-read-agent-history:` and a body. File an
issue only when the user explicitly asks you to do so. If they have not asked,
offer the draft and issue page for their review; do not post or open anything
automatically.

When the user explicitly authorizes filing and `gh` is installed (`gh --version` succeeds), create the issue with structured arguments. Put the reviewed body in a UTF-8 temporary file and pass its literal path with `--body-file`; do not interpolate feedback into shell code.

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo ElliotDrel/e-stack \
  --title "<reviewed title>" \
  --body-file "<path-to-reviewed-UTF-8-body-file>"
```

If `gh` is unavailable, give the user the reviewed title and body to paste into a
new issue at `https://github.com/ElliotDrel/e-stack/issues/new`.

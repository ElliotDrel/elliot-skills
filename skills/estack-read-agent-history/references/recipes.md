# Recipes

Multi-step workflows. For per-mode flag reference, see `modes.md`. For schema, see `jsonl-schema.md`.

These recipes use the CLI where a mode fits the step exactly. When a step needs different filtering, joining, or output shape, post-process the mode's `--format json` output, or switch to a scratchpad script importing `scripts/lib/` (docstrings are the API reference) — don't chain three CLI calls to approximate what ten lines of Python answer directly.

**Found a new workflow that worked (or one below that misled you)?** Update this file at the source repo — see SKILL.md § "Update this skill with what you learn".

In all examples, `$PY` refers to:
```
~/.agents/skills/estack-read-agent-history/scripts/read_transcript.py
```

## 1. Post-`/compact` recovery

When `/compact` has rolled the conversation and you need what fell off the back end:

```bash
# Step 1: Recover the long version of recent assistant output
python "$PY" --file <current-session.jsonl> --mode pre-compact

# Step 2: If advisor responses were involved, grab those separately
python "$PY" --file <current-session.jsonl> --mode advisor

# Step 3: If a search would be faster than reading the whole pre-compact section
python "$PY" --file <current-session.jsonl> --mode search --query "<keyword>"
```

The `pre-compact` window is 40 message-exchanges before the most recent compact. If multiple `/compact` events fired, only the most recent is used as the anchor.

---

## 2. Find-then-dump (resume work from a session you can't name)

```bash
# Step 1: Find by partial title or first prompt
python "$PY" --mode find --title "supabase"
#   → returns a list, including the full session UUIDs

# Step 2: Get a 6-line summary to confirm it's the right one
python "$PY" --file <picked-session>.jsonl --mode brief

# Step 3: Dump the recent context to ground yourself
python "$PY" --file <picked-session>.jsonl --mode dump -n 20

# Step 4: Get the resume command for that session
python "$PY" --mode resume-cmd --uuid <8-char-prefix>
```

---

## 3. Fan-out triage (you spawned N parallel subagents and want every output)

```bash
# Option A: Get all subagent finals in one shot, separated by headers
python "$PY" --file <parent-session>.jsonl --mode subagent-finals

# Option B: Triage with a brief that includes subagent finals folded in
python "$PY" --file <parent-session>.jsonl --mode brief --include-subagents

# Option C: List first to see what types of agents ran
python "$PY" --file <parent-session>.jsonl --mode subagent-list

# Drill into one specific subagent's tools / files
python "$PY" --mode subagent-tools --subagent <subagent-path>
python "$PY" --mode subagent-files --subagent <subagent-path>
```

The `brief --include-subagents` output is the densest form of the standard "what did all my agents do" question and was designed for fan-out reproduction (14 parallel briefs ≡ a 14-subagent investigation).

---

## 4. Deletion-incident recovery (March 2026 auto-update bug, GitHub #41591)

**Start here when you have a list of UUIDs to triage** (saved `c -r` lines, a
notes file, a Coursicle-style backlog). One sweep classifies all of them across
every root, so you know which are worth chasing before opening anything:

```bash
python "$PY" --mode resumable --uuid-file ids.txt --deep
```

- `LIVE` → resume normally. `BACKUP` → restore from the named root (below).
- `ORPHAN` → the parent transcript is gone from live AND every backup; only
  subagent sidecars survive. Do not go hunting in the backups, it is not there.
  Read what is left with `--file <uuid>\subagents\agent-*.jsonl --mode dump`.
- `WAS-REAL` / `LIKELY-REAL` → genuinely existed, nothing recoverable locally.
- `MISSING` → no trace at all; suspect a typo before assuming data loss.

The per-uuid recovery flow below is for the `BACKUP` ones.

When a live `.jsonl` has been wiped but the backup is intact:

```bash
# Step 1: Find what's missing — list live vs snapshot side by side
python "$PY" --root live        --cwd "C:\Users\2supe\Other Claude Code" --mode list > live.txt
python "$PY" --root snapshot-24h --cwd "C:\Users\2supe\Other Claude Code" --mode list > snap.txt
diff live.txt snap.txt

# Step 2: For each missing UUID, locate it in the snapshot
python "$PY" --root snapshot-24h --mode lookup --uuid <prefix>

# Step 3: Read it directly from the snapshot path
python "$PY" --file <snapshot-path>.jsonl --mode brief
python "$PY" --file <snapshot-path>.jsonl --mode dump

# Step 4: If the 24h snapshot is also affected, walk back further
python "$PY" --root snapshot-1w  --mode lookup --uuid <prefix>
python "$PY" --root snapshot-1mo --mode lookup --uuid <prefix>
```

The four backup roots (`mirror`, `snapshot-24h`, `snapshot-1w`, `snapshot-1mo`) are maintained by a scheduled backup task on this machine.

## 5. Week-in-review journal

```bash
# Every session in every project from the last 7 days
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode journal --since 7d

# Single project, with a hard upper bound
python "$PY" --cwd "C:\Users\2supe\Other Claude Code" \
  --mode journal --since 2026-05-13 --until 2026-05-20

# By project name instead of path
python "$PY" --project keel --mode journal --since 7d

# Count how many sessions touched a topic
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode count --query "linkedin"
```

The output is one 5-line block per session: `date·uuid·project` / first prompt / last assistant message / N files edited / top tools.

---

## 5b. Day accounting ("where did my day go?")

```bash
# Block-grouped timeline of yesterday across ALL projects, with idle gaps
python "$PY" --mode timeline --date yesterday

# How much time on one project today
python "$PY" --mode timeline --project keel --date today

# Tighter idle threshold (treat >5m quiet as a break between blocks)
python "$PY" --mode timeline --date today --gap 5m

# Multi-day window
python "$PY" --mode timeline --since 2026-06-01 --until 2026-06-03
```

Reading the output: each block is a contiguous stretch of activity (events ≤ gap
apart); the sessions inside it are listed with message counts; `── idle Xm ──`
lines mark the breaks; the totals line gives block count, span, and session count.

Caveat: timeline maps *session* activity (Claude's work included) — it makes no
claim about your attention time. For "how long did this actually take ME?", use
`--mode engagement` (recipe 5d).

---

## 5d. Attention accounting ("how long did X actually take me?")

`engagement` measures *your* time, not the session's. The full attribution
rules (one merged stream, waiting-credit, breaks) are in `modes.md` § engagement.

```bash
# How much focused time did today actually consume?
python "$PY" --mode engagement --date today

# One project over a week
python "$PY" --mode engagement --project keel --since 7d

# One session, window auto-derived from its first→last prompt
python "$PY" --mode engagement --file <session.jsonl>

# Strict mode: anything over 5 minutes quiet is a break
python "$PY" --mode engagement --date today --break 5m
```

Reading the output: one row per session (`active / ratio / msgs / first–last`),
a total line (already interval-merged, safe to quote), and the breaks in the
merged stream.

---

## 5c. Piping structured output into a next step

Every mode supports `--format json`. **Run pipe chains in Bash** (the Bash tool /
git-bash) — they work exactly as written:

```bash
# Pull the paths of yesterday's sessions for batch processing
python "$PY" --mode list --all-projects --since yesterday --format json \
  | python -c "import json,sys; [print(s['path']) for s in json.load(sys.stdin)]"

# Machine-readable day totals (attention time → engagement, not timeline)
python "$PY" --mode engagement --date yesterday --format json \
  | python -c "import json,sys; t=json.load(sys.stdin)['totals']; print(t['active_minutes'], 'min across', t['sessions'], 'sessions')"
```

PowerShell warnings (5.1):
- Piping between native commands injects a UTF-8 BOM and re-encodes through the
  console codepage (can corrupt non-ASCII transcript content). If you must pipe
  in PowerShell, read stdin as `utf-8-sig`:
  `python -c "import io,json,sys; data=json.load(io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdin.buffer, encoding='utf-8-sig'))"`
- `>` redirection writes UTF-16 — read redirected files with `encoding='utf-16'`.

Prefer Bash for any JSON chaining; prefer either shell for plain single commands.

---

## 5e. Cross-agent day review (Claude Code + Codex together)

The day-accounting modes read **both** agents by default (`--agent both`); see
`modes.md` § `--agent` for the merge semantics.

```bash
# Everything yesterday, both agents, one merged timeline
python "$PY" --mode timeline --date yesterday

# Real attention time across both agents
python "$PY" --mode engagement --date yesterday

# Numbered per-session day review (Codex rows tagged "codex ▹")
python "$PY" --mode session-report --date yesterday

# Narrow to one agent
python "$PY" --mode session-report --date yesterday --agent codex
python "$PY" --mode timeline --date yesterday --agent claude

# Read a single Codex session directly (auto-detected — no --agent needed)
ls ~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/15/                       # the date folder IS the index
python "$PY" --file ~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/15/rollout-*.jsonl --mode brief
```

Do NOT hand-roll the cross-agent active-time math with `grep '"timestamp"'` + `awk` —
you'd re-derive the merge with a hardcoded UTC→local offset and lose the dedup the
modes already do. Codex schema + traps: `codex-history.md`.

---

## 6. Sibling-agent diff

When you ran two subagents on the same task and want to see where they diverged:

```bash
# Auto-pick the first two subagents of a session
python "$PY" --mode diff --subagents-of <parent-session>.jsonl

# Explicit pairing
python "$PY" --mode diff \
  --file-a <parent-uuid>/subagents/agent-aaa.jsonl \
  --file-b <parent-uuid>/subagents/agent-bbb.jsonl
```

Output is timestamp-interleaved, prefixed `A>` / `B>`. Use it to spot disagreement (e.g. one agent recommended X and the other recommended Y) without reading both transcripts in full.

---

## 7. "What is this session actually for?" (cold open on a stale UUID)

```bash
# Single-shot orientation in under a second
python "$PY" --file <unknown-session>.jsonl --mode brief

# If you need more than 200 chars of context per line
python "$PY" --file <unknown-session>.jsonl --mode last -n 3
python "$PY" --file <unknown-session>.jsonl --mode changelog | tail -30
```

`brief` is the recommended default for triaging a session you've never read.

---

## 8. Tool-call forensics ("when did I last `git push --force`?")

```bash
# Find which sessions contain a matching tool_use, across all projects
# (returns a per-session summary by default: one line per session with hit count + snippet)
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode search --query "git push --force" --in tool_use

# Add --full to expand to match windows instead of the per-session summary
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode search --query "git push --force" --in tool_use --full

# Get full forensics on the session that matched
python "$PY" --file <matching-session>.jsonl --mode tool-calls --tool Bash
```

Wide-scope search (`--all-projects`, `--cwd`, `--project`) returns a **per-session summary** by default — one line per matching session with a hit count and first snippet — so the output stays under the harness's Read cap. Add `--full` to expand to match windows (bounded by a ~10k-token budget; degrades back to summary with a note if it overflows). Single-file search (`--file`) always returns full windows.

---

## 8b. "Which skills (or tools) do I actually use?" — true invocation counts

To decide which skills to keep or prune, you need real usage counts. Use
`tool-usage`, never `search`/`count` — the why (string matches over-count;
`tool-usage` keys on invocation structure) is in `modes.md` § tool-usage.

```bash
# Skills you actually invoked, ranked, across every project
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode tool-usage --tool Skill

# All tools (skills broken out under the Skill row)
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode tool-usage

# One project, last 30 days, excluding this very session
python "$PY" --project keel --mode tool-usage --tool Skill --since 30d --exclude-current

# Machine-readable: skills sorted by count
python "$PY" --all-projects --mode tool-usage --tool Skill --format json \
  | python -c "import json,sys; [print(s['count'], s['skill']) for s in json.load(sys.stdin)['skills']]"
```

A skill missing from the output was never invoked in that scope — a positive
inventory ("here is everything I used, and X isn't in it") is stronger evidence
of non-use than a search that simply returns nothing.

---

## 9. Resume previous session in the current project

If you just `cd`'d into a project and want to pick up where you left off:

```bash
python "$PY" --cwd "$(pwd)" --mode resume-prev -n 15
```

Prints `--- Resuming from <uuid> (<mtime>) ---` then the last 15 exchanges.

---

## 10. Schema drift / silent empty results

When a mode returns nothing and you don't know why:

```bash
python "$PY" --file <session>.jsonl --mode debug
```

Look for:
- Unfamiliar `type:` values appearing in the distribution (parser might be dropping them as noise).
- An absent `advisor_tool_result` block when you expected advisor output.
- Missing `compact` markers in a session you know got compacted.

If the drift is real (a new entry type, a changed block shape), document it in `jsonl-schema.md` at the source repo and adjust `lib/parser.py` — see SKILL.md § "Update this skill with what you learn".

---

## 11. When no recipe fits: the scratch-script pattern

Most real questions don't map to a canned mode ("which sessions edited files under src/ but never ran tests?", "average time between my prompt and Claude's first reply, per project"). Don't approximate them with CLI flags — write the exact query:

```python
# <scratchpad>/query.py
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.home() / ".agents/skills/estack-read-agent-history/scripts"))
from lib import parser, paths, search, subagents, tools, codex

since = paths.parse_timespec("7d")
for pd in paths.list_projects():                 # or filter_projects(None, "keel")
    for f in paths.list_transcripts(pd, since=since):
        lines = parser.parse_lines(f)            # cached — cheap to re-call
        # …exactly the question being asked…
```

Rules of the pattern:
- Script lives in the scratchpad, never the user's project.
- Use the lib for classification, timestamps, and discovery (its docstrings explain the traps each function handles); write only the question-specific logic yourself.
- Print a bounded, per-session summary first; expand details selectively — a raw dump of a cross-project sweep blows the output cap.
- If the script's technique is reusable, promote it into these recipes at the source repo; if the same gap keeps recurring, add a small mode or flag to the CLI instead.

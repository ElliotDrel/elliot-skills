# Examples of Good Prompts

Reference material for the prompt-builder skill. Read it when an example would
help clarify the user's task, and show it when they ask for examples.

The pattern to notice: a useful request includes the details that change the
work. It may be longer or shorter than the original; length is not the goal.

## Part 1: Thin ask vs good prompt

The thin version returns the average of everything on the internet. The good version changes the assignment.

### Marketing plan

Thin ask:

> a marketing plan

Good prompt:

> a launch plan for a technical audience that already understands the category, is skeptical of vendor claims, and needs to see implementation details before believing the product

Why it works: it names the audience, what that audience already believes, and what would make the output unusable to them.

### Resume feedback

Thin ask:

> feedback on my resume

Good prompt:

> review this resume for a senior operator moving into AI-native product roles. Focus on whether the evidence shows judgment, shipped work, and ability to use AI in real workflows rather than generic AI enthusiasm

Why it works: it sets the goal (a specific role transition) and the quality bar (judgment, shipped work, real-workflow AI use, not enthusiasm). It turns a vague request into a real evaluation with criteria.

### Transcript summary

Thin ask:

> summarize this transcript

Good prompt:

> turn this transcript into attendance-replacement notes for a team that needs decisions, owners, open questions, and next steps. Ignore small talk and flag uncertain attribution

Why it works: it names the goal (attendance-replacement notes), the definition of done (decisions, owners, open questions, next steps), and the edges of the flashlight (ignore small talk, flag uncertain attribution).

### The same shift at the field level

For the Goal field specifically, the contrast is:

Bad:

> Help me with this deck.

Better:

> Help me turn this rough strategy deck into a board-ready discussion document that supports a decision about whether to fund the pilot.

The better version states the outcome, not the activity.

## Part 2: Full briefs

These are fuller prompts for work where the extra context changes the result.
They are examples, not a required format.

### Research brief for an article

> I want to develop a substantive Substack piece for learners and builders. The working angle is that working with AI agents makes you a better communicator. The reader problem is that people get mediocre AI output and think they need prompt tricks, when the deeper issue is that they have not defined the work. Do not draft yet. Check the archive so we do not repeat earlier pieces. Avoid generic prompt-engineering advice. Produce a research brief, thesis, outline, examples, and a practical template.

Field by field:
- Goal: a substantive Substack piece, with a working angle to hold.
- Context: who it is for (learners and builders) and the reader problem the piece must solve.
- Sources: check the archive so earlier pieces are not repeated.
- Constraints: do not draft yet; avoid generic prompt-engineering advice.
- Definition of done: a research brief, thesis, outline, examples, and a practical template.

### Board-ready discussion document

> I need help turning this rough strategy deck into a board-ready discussion document. The audience is deciding whether to fund the pilot. Use the attached financial model, meeting notes, and current operating plan. Do not invent numbers or change the company voice. The quality bar is clear, plain business English with every claim tied to a source. Return a revised outline first, then stop for review.

Field by field:
- Goal: a board-ready discussion document, not a deck.
- Context: the audience is making a fund-or-kill decision on the pilot.
- Sources: the financial model, meeting notes, and operating plan, named explicitly.
- Constraints: do not invent numbers; do not change the company voice.
- Quality bar: clear, plain business English with every claim tied to a source.
- Definition of done: a revised outline first, then a hard stop for review.

### Meeting prep brief

> I have a 30-minute meeting with a potential partner tomorrow. The goal is to decide whether there is enough overlap to schedule a deeper technical session. Use the attached notes and their website. Give me a one-page prep brief with their likely priorities, three questions I should ask, two risks to watch for, and a suggested opening framing. Do not draft a sales pitch. I want to understand fit, not force a deal.

Field by field:
- Goal: decide whether there is enough overlap for a deeper technical session.
- Context: a 30-minute meeting with a potential partner, tomorrow.
- Sources: the attached notes and the partner's website.
- Constraints: do not draft a sales pitch; the aim is fit, not closing a deal.
- Quality bar and definition of done: a one-page prep brief with their likely priorities, three questions, two risks, and a suggested opening framing.

## The takeaway

Across all of these, the useful prompt makes the work legible: it states the
outcome and adds the context, sources, boundaries, and finish line that matter.

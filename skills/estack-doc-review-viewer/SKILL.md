# estack-doc-review-viewer

A dependency-free local web app for reviewing a markdown document with a human in
the loop. It versions the document automatically, shows a diff between any two
versions, lets the reviewer highlight any passage and hold a threaded
conversation on it, and gives them a **Send to Claude** button that wakes you
without switching back to the terminal.

Node standard library only on the server. The page carries one vendored file,
google/diff-match-patch (Apache-2.0), checked in rather than installed. No
`npm install`, no network, nothing to build.

## Your entire job

Two commands, then edit files. Everything else is the code's problem.

```bash
review() { node "$HOME/.agents/skills/estack-doc-review-viewer/review.mjs" "$@"; }

review open path/to/doc.md      # 1. before you edit anything
review claim                    # 2. when feedback is ready, this hands it over
#      ... edit the file ...
review reply <threadId> what you changed and why
review publish                  # 3. hand it back
```

You never choose a port, a version number, a state directory, or a slug. You
never track what you have already read. Run `open` **before** your first edit so
v1 captures the original text.

## Getting woken

`open` prints the slug, the URL, and the exact watcher command. When the host has a
persistent monitoring facility, run the watcher through it:

```bash
review watch --slug plan
```

Each line it prints can wake the session. If the host cannot monitor persistently, tell
the user how to return to the review and use `review pending` or `review status --slug <slug>`
when the session next runs; claim only when the phase is `submitted`. Waking is per session
per slug: the daemon is shared, and each session watches only the process it launched.

## The hand-off

One field says whose turn it is, and everything follows from it.

| Phase | Meaning | Who moves it |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewing` | The user's turn. They read and comment. | you, via `publish` |
| `submitted` | They clicked Send. You have not picked the round up. | them, via the button |
| `editing` | You claimed the round and are working. The button locks. | you, via `claim` |

The loop:

1. `open` the document. v1 is snapshotted before you touch it.
2. You edit. `publish`. That mints v2 and returns the document to the user.
3. They comment and click **Send to Claude**. The phase becomes `submitted`.
4. A watcher prints one line, or a later `pending`/`status` check finds `submitted`.
5. `claim` prints the unread messages and flips to `editing`.
6. You edit and reply in-thread. `publish` mints v3. Back to step 3.

While you hold the round the page is curtained and the server serves the last
snapshot instead of the working file, so the user can never catch a half-written
document mid-`Write`.

This state is **level-triggered**. If your session dies, the daemon is killed, or
the machine reboots, `review.json` still says `submitted` and the next process to
look knows exactly what is owed. Nothing has to be consumed exactly once.

New to you is every message from the user that the marker has not passed. `claim`
returns those and advances the marker in one atomic write, so a crash cannot
half-claim a round. `pending` shows the same thing without claiming, and is safe
any time.

## Comment anchoring, and what it means for your edits

Comments anchor to the **quoted text**, not the line number, and re-resolve on
every render. Insert twenty lines above a commented bullet and the comment
follows it. That is deliberate: you will be editing the document while their
comments sit on it.

If you **rewrite the exact text they quoted**, the comment orphans. It is not
lost and never silently reattached to text it was not written about. It moves to
an **Anchor lost** group above the resolved fold, drawn in yellow, still showing
the quote it was written against. It is flagged, not faded: it still counts and
still sends.

You are told when this happens. `claim`, `pending`, and `publish` all report
orphaned threads by id and quote, so you do not have to remember to check:

```
!! 1 comment(s) lost their anchor because of the edits you just published:
   c4f2...  quoted: "Ship the redesign in Q3."
```

When you see that, **reply in the thread saying what you changed, then resolve
it**. Otherwise the user is left with a flagged card and no answer.

## Versioning

Snapshots are minted by code on `publish`, never by you. A pass that leaves the
document byte-identical does not earn a version number, and `publish` says so.

In the page, the **Compare** selectors choose any two versions. The default is
the previous snapshot against the working file, which is exactly "what changed in
the pass you just did." Viewing anything other than the working file on the right
puts the page in read-only history mode, so a comment can never be written
against text the working document no longer has.

## The CLI

```bash
$R open <file.md> [--slug s] [--no-browser]   host it, snapshot v1, print the watch command
$R watch --slug <slug>                        the Monitor stream
$R status | pending | claim | publish | threads | versions   [--slug s] [--json]
$R reply <threadId> your text here
$R resolve <threadId> | reopen <threadId>
$R comment --body "..."                       a general note on the document
$R ps | stop | close --slug <slug>
```

With one document open, `--slug` is optional. With several, the CLI refuses to
guess and names the choices. `--doc <file>` works instead of `--slug`.

`reply`, `resolve`, and `reopen` are the exception: a thread id identifies its
document on its own, so those never need `--slug` even with several open.

Two sessions can review two documents at once. Each runs its own `open` and its
own `watch`; the second `open` finds the daemon already running and registers
with it. Slugs come from the filename and are stable across restarts.

## Where state lives

Nothing this skill creates is written next to the document. The user's working
directory keeps their files and only their files.

Everything this skill persists lives in one folder, `~/.e-stack/estack-doc-review-viewer`.
Every e-stack skill that stores anything gets its own folder under `~/.e-stack`,
so there is one directory to find, back up, or delete rather than a dotfile per
skill scattered across the home directory.

```
~/.e-stack/estack-doc-review-viewer/registry.json    slug -> {document, stateDir}
~/.e-stack/estack-doc-review-viewer/daemon.json      the daemon's url and pid
~/.e-stack/estack-doc-review-viewer/docs/<slug>/
  review.json     phase, round, seq, version manifest, every thread
  versions/       v0001.md, v0002.md, ...
```

Never hand-edit `review.json` while the daemon is running. Every write goes
through one serialized queue inside it, and an outside write can be silently
overwritten by the next mutation.

## Traps

- **Run `open` before your first edit.** It snapshots v1 from the file as it
  stands. Edit first and v1 is your rewrite, with the original gone.
- **Do not reply to a thread while they are testing the Send button.** Replying
  flips it out of the awaiting set, the button greys out to "nothing to send",
  and it looks broken.
- **If `review.json` stops parsing, the daemon refuses to overwrite it** and
  returns the error instead of resetting. That is what keeps their comments
  recoverable. Fix it by hand and restart.

## Editing this skill's own code

Read `INTERNALS.md` in this directory first. It carries the architecture, the
diff algorithm, the HTTP routes, and the failure modes that bite when you change
any of them. Run `node selftest.mjs` and `node e2etest.mjs` after any edit.

## Skill Feedback

If the user shares feedback about this skill — a bug, something confusing, a missing feature, or a suggestion — capture the useful details: what they expected, what happened, and relevant context. If they already provided enough detail, do not ask them to repeat it.

Draft a concise issue title prefixed with `estack-doc-review-viewer:` and a body. File an
issue only when the user explicitly asks you to do so. If they have not asked,
offer the draft and issue page for their review; do not post or open anything
automatically.

When the user explicitly authorizes filing and `gh` is installed (`gh --version` succeeds), create the issue with structured arguments. Put the reviewed body in a UTF-8 temporary file and pass its literal path with `--body-file`; do not interpolate feedback into shell code.

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo ElliotDrel/e-stack \
  --title "<reviewed title>" \
  --body-file "<path-to-reviewed-UTF-8-body-file>"
```

If `gh` is unavailable, give the user the reviewed title and body to paste into a
new issue at `https://github.com/ElliotDrel/e-stack/issues/new`.

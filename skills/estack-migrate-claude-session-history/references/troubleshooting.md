# Troubleshooting

Specific failure modes that have actually happened, with the diagnostic and the fix.

## Stale reference false positive

**Symptom.** The script prints, for the migrated file:

```
Stale reference in: <new-path>\<uuid>.jsonl (matches: C:\\Users\\...)
WARNING: Found N file(s) in the new project dir that still contain old path references.
```

**When this is harmless.** When the **new** project path contains the **old** project path as a prefix (e.g. you migrated `C:\Users\me\Workspace` → `C:\Users\me\Workspace\Sub-Project`), every successfully rewritten occurrence of the new path also contains the old path as a substring. The verifier does naive substring matching, so it flags itself.

**Diagnostic — count GENUINELY stale occurrences.** Run the bundled validator with `--old-repo` and `--new-repo`; the "Stale path references" check uses a negative-lookahead that filters out the prefix-containment false positives. It also scopes the check to entries that existed at migration time, ignoring any later activity that legitimately references the old path:

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/validate-migration.py \
  "<target-jsonl>" \
  --old-repo "<source-real-path>" \
  --new-repo "<target-real-path>"
```

If that check passes, the migration script's own warning was a false positive — move on. If it fails, the failure detail names the specific entries and counts; figure out which encoding variant the migration script missed (see `path-encoding.md`) and either re-run with a fix or hand-patch the file.

## Sidecar / subagent files left behind

**Symptom.** The migrated session's brief shows `subagents: 0`, but the original had several. Or `--mode subagent-list` against the migrated file returns nothing.

**Cause.** In an older version of the script's single-session mode, only the top-level `<uuid>.jsonl` was copied — the `<uuid>/subagents/` sidecar directory was missed because the filter matched on basename only.

**Fix.** The current script copies the sidecar tree automatically when `--session` is set. If you see this symptom, you're running an out-of-date copy of the script. Use the bundled one at `scripts/migrate-claude-history.js`.

**Recovery if it already happened.** First compare the target transcript, sidecar tree, and pre-migration backup to prove this is the same incomplete migration. If so, use a recovery run that adds only the missing known sidecars and preserves the validated target transcript. If the target UUID belongs to another migration, has conflicting content, or cannot be matched to the backup, stop and inspect it; do not blindly rerun or combine sidecar trees.

## Ambiguous UUID lookup

**Symptom.** After migration, `estack-read-agent-history` lookup mode returns:

```
Ambiguous prefix '<uuid>' matches 2 sessions:
  <source-project>/<uuid>.jsonl
  <target-project>/<uuid>.jsonl
```

**Cause.** This is expected and correct — the migration is non-destructive. The source copy is still in place as a safety net until the user confirms `/resume` works under the new project.

**Fix.** Once the user has confirmed the migrated session resumes correctly under the new project, delete the source copy:

```powershell
Remove-Item "<source-project-encoded-dir>\<uuid>.jsonl"
Remove-Item -Recurse "<source-project-encoded-dir>\<uuid>"  # sidecar dir
```

Never delete before the user confirms. The backup folder is a fallback if the user discovers something broken later, but the in-place source copy is the fastest recovery path.

## /resume doesn't show the session under the new project

**Symptom.** User runs `claude` in the new project's working directory, types `/resume`, and the migrated session doesn't appear in the list.

**Diagnosis — go through these in order.**

1. **Confirm the migrated `.jsonl` is in the right encoded folder.** The folder under `~/.claude/projects/` must exactly match the encoded form of the **real** path the user is `cd`'d into. Case differences (`C--Foo` vs `c--Foo`) and missing/added hyphens both break the match. Compare: get the real cwd → encode it (drop drive colon, replace separators with `-`) → ensure that's the folder name.

2. **Confirm the `cwd` field inside the entries matches.** A surprising amount of `/resume` logic keys off the entries' `cwd` field, not the folder name. Run the distinct-cwd check from SKILL.md step 7 — every entry should be the new path (or empty for marker entries).

3. **Confirm the `.jsonl` is not zero-byte or malformed.** Open it: `python -c "import json; [json.loads(l) for l in open(r'<path>', encoding='utf-8') if l.strip()]"` — if this errors, the migration corrupted something.

4. **Check whether Claude Code stripped or reordered entries.** Claude Code occasionally writes `permission-mode` and `ai-title` metadata entries when something opens a file. These are harmless. But if the count is far off from the original (say, more than +5), something else is wrong.

## "Cannot find old project directory" error from the script

**Symptom.** Script exits with: `Could not find old Claude project directory. Checked: ...`

**Cause.** The `--old-repo` value's encoded form doesn't match any folder under `~/.claude/projects/`. Most often this is because the user gave a real path that doesn't actually have any sessions yet (the project folder gets created lazily).

**Fix.** Use `estack-read-agent-history` lookup to locate the source transcript, then read its recorded `cwd` field. Do not reverse-engineer a real path from the hyphenated folder name: a real path can itself contain hyphens, so the encoding is not reversible. If `cwd` is absent or stale, establish the source path from the user's project context before retrying.

## The migration note was accidentally appended twice

**Symptom.** Two `<session-migration-note>` blocks at the tail of the file.

**Cause.** Pre-fix versions of the append routine didn't dedupe; or the file was edited between two script runs.

**Fix.** The current script checks the last few entries for an existing `<session-migration-note>` and won't append a duplicate. To clean up an already-doubled note, hand-edit the file: remove the older note entry, keep the newer one. Always backup the file first.

## Forgetting `--session` and migrating the whole project

**Symptom.** Script copies hundreds of files, takes much longer than expected, prints replacement counts in the thousands. The target project dir suddenly has many `.jsonl` files.

**Cause.** Without `--session`, the script's default mode migrates **every** session in the source project — that's how the script was originally written, for the rename-a-project use case.

**Fix.** Stop the script (Ctrl-C if still running). Compare the target project dir with its backup to identify only the files the mistaken run added. Preserve that evidence and ask the user before removing any of those files; then re-run with `--session <uuid>`.

This is why backing up the **target** dir matters as much as backing up the source — without it, recovering from this mistake is much harder.

# AGENTS.md

This is my personal skill pack for Claude Code — skills I use every day that I want to share with the world so others can do the same things I do. The goal is always to benefit the users as much as possible.

When you're working in this repo, you're doing one of two things: improving an existing skill, or improving the experience of using the skills (install flow, skill UX). Hold both in mind.

One naming note: "the skill folder" means `~/.agents/skills/` — that's where Codex and OpenClaw read from. Claude reads from `~/.claude/skills/`, which is just a symlink into the agents folder. The agents folder is the source of truth; don't edit the claude copy directly.

The same split applies inside this repo, one level down: this repo's own dev-tooling skill lives at `.agents/skills/manage-e-stack/` (source of truth, tracked in git). `.claude/skills/` is a local directory junction pointing at `.agents/skills/` — untracked, gitignored, regenerated per machine. Don't edit anything under `.claude/skills/` directly; edit `.agents/skills/manage-e-stack/` instead. `.claude/settings.json` is the one exception — it's Claude Code-only config, not agent-agnostic, so it stays a real file directly under `.claude/` rather than moving under `.agents/`.

Where skills put their files matters to me. Durable internal skill state goes
under `~/.e-stack/<skill-folder>/` — one directory I can find, back up, or
delete, not a dotfile per skill sprayed across my home directory. Requested
deliverables belong where the user asks, generated skills belong in the skills
directory, and read-only data owned by another tool remains in that tool's
location. Nothing gets stored under `~/.claude/` as E-Stack skill state. Every
API key in the pack lives in one shared file, `~/.e-stack/.env`, never one per
skill — so I set a key once and every skill that needs it can find it. Append to
that file, never overwrite it. See `docs/skill-authoring.md`.

Two things I care enough about to name explicitly: publishing and syncing. Publishing is tag-triggered — any version tag kicks off a real npm release, so never push one without intent. Prep is split from publish — "get it ready but don't publish" is its own route (prep) in manage-e-stack. Syncing skills to the live location is destructive — always show me the diff and wait for my go-ahead before running the install. Before any publish, update all relevant docs to reflect what changed — README descriptions, AGENTS.md listing, and any docs/ reference files.

| Task | Action |
|---|---|
| Any change to a skill or hook | Invoke `manage-e-stack` (project-local skill at `.agents/skills/manage-e-stack/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/manage-e-stack/`) |
| Process a book, PDF, or other reference doc into a reusable on-demand skill | Invoke `estack-book-extractor` |
| Skill authoring reference | Read `docs/skill-authoring.md` |
| Hook authoring reference | Read `docs/hook-authoring.md` |
| Publishing, OIDC, or repo security | Read `docs/publishing.md` |

| Doc | Read when… |
|---|---|
| `docs/skill-authoring.md` | Creating or editing a skill — versioning rules, feedback section, auto-run commands, doc listing requirements, where a skill stores its state |
| `docs/hook-authoring.md` | Creating or editing a hook — script shape, stdin/stdout contract, settings.json registration, testing |
| `docs/publishing.md` | Releasing to npm or auditing repo security — publish flow, branch protection, OIDC configuration |
| `docs/manual-publish.md` | Publishing manually from the CLI when GitHub Actions are unavailable — prerequisite settings to re-enable, token bypass, cleanup checklist |
| `docs/changelog-maintenance.md` | Updating `CHANGELOG.md` — when and how to write unreleased entries, how to promote them on publish |
| `docs/research/codex-claude-cli-orchestration-findings.md` | Editing `estack-drive-cli-agent` — the full research record behind it (CLI flag semantics, sourced footguns, openai-codex plugin failure autopsy, prior art) |
